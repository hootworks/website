### Media Domain

<br>

* **Cloud-native workflows** for media ingest, transcoding, QC, packaging and delivery
<br>*e.g. petabyte-scale archive processing in multi-cloud and hybrid environments*<br><br>
* **Live and file-based media pipelines and streaming solutions**
<br>*e.g. distributed production and delivery systems for film, news, and broadcast*<br><br>
* **Metadata management, MAM and workflow orchestration**
<br>*e.g. automated technical metadata extraction integrated into asset management platforms*<br><br>
* **Video codecs, formats and standards** (MPEG, SMPTE, W3C)
<br>*e.g. DASH/HLS packaging, IMF/MXF CPL rendering, EXR/TIFF/DPX image sequences*<br><br>
* **Standards participation and contribution**
<br>*e.g. co-editor of MPEG 14496-34 (SDL), active contributor via BSI national body*

### Technical Domain

<br>

* **Custom media applications and microservices** using Java, Python, C/C++, and TypeScript
<br>*e.g. containerised processing engines built for scalable deployment*<br><br>
* **Open source integration** with FFmpeg, GStreamer, REST APIs and SDKs
<br>*e.g. embedded processing components for automated content workflows*<br><br>
* **Infrastructure and DevOps** with AWS, Azurew, GCP, Kubernetes, KEDA, Helm, HashiCorp stack, CI/CD
<br>*e.g. auto-scaling production pipelines, shift-left testing, infrastructure as code deployments*<br><br>
* **End-to-end system design** from prototyping and R&D through to production delivery
<br>*e.g. migration of a desktop colour grading application to a scalable SaaS platform*<br><br>
* **FFmpeg optimisation and custom development**
<br>*e.g. CUDA filter integration for embedded GPU, object storage optimisation, custom patching and bug fixing*
