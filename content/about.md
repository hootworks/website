**Hoot Works** is the consulting practice of **Nick Ryan**, a UK-based media technology expert with over two decades of experience developing, architecting, and advising on advanced software systems for the media and broadcast industries. While primarily led by Nick, Hoot Works can scale through a trusted network of collaborators when projects require additional capacity or specialised expertise.

With a background in signal processing, a history of startup success, and deep hands-on technical experience, Nick brings a rare blend of insight and execution to every engagement.

His career spans roles in R&D labs, media startups, and global software vendors. As founder of Nativ and technical architect of Mio (now known as Dalet Flex), Nick built one of the industry's most innovative media management platforms. Since then, as Principal Consultant at Hoot Works, he has provided services to companies across the UK, Europe and the US â€” ranging from high-level technical strategy to detailed hands-on development.

Clients value his ability to bridge creative, business and technical teams, delivering solutions that are not only functional and scalable, but tailored to real-world media workflows. He also participates in international standards work, bringing both thought leadership and implementation knowledge to bear.
